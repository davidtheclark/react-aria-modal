  <h1>
    react-aria-modal demo
  </h1>

  <p>
    When a modal is active, you should notice the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Focus is trapped within the modal: Tab and Shift+Tab will cycle through the modal's focusable nodes
        without returning to the main document beneath.
      </li>
      <li>
        The dialog element has an ARIA <code>role</code> of <code>dialog</code> (or <code>alertdialog</code>).
      </li>
      <li>
        The dialog element has an ARIA attribute designating its title, either <code>aria-label</code> or <code>aria-labelledby</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Escape will close the modal.
      </li>
      <li>
        By default, clicking on the modal's underlay (outside the dialog element) will close the modal (this can be disabled).
      </li>
      <li>
        Scrolling is frozen on the main document beneath the modal. (Although, sadly, you can still mess with the scrolling using a touch screen.)
      </li>
      <li>
        The modal is appended to the end of <code>document.body</code> instead of its taking up its source-order position within the React component tree.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>
    demo one
  </h2>
  <p>
    This modal
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      has an invisible but still screen-reader-accessible title
    </li>
    <li>
      places initial focus on the deactivation button
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div id="demo-one"></div>

  <h2>
    demo two
  </h2>
  <p>
    This modal
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      is vertically centered
    </li>
    <li>
      does not close when the underlay is clicked
    </li>
    <li>
      has a visible title (which is also used by the screen-reader)
    </li>
    <li>
      does not deliberately place focus, so the first element in the tab order receives focus
    </li>
    <li>
      has an internally scrolling region
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div id="demo-two"></div>

  <h2>
    demo three
  </h2>
  <p>
    This modal
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      is tall enough that scrolling is required to see all of its content
    </li>
    <li>
      adds a tabIndex to the dialog element itself, without outline, so the focus trap
      still works but no focus outline is initially visible
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div id="demo-three"></div>

  <h2>
    demo four
  </h2>
  <p>
    This modal's active/inactive state is controlled with the <code>mounted</code> prop instead of
    mounting and unmounting.
  </p>
  <div id="demo-four"></div>

  <script src="demo-bundle.js"></script>
</body>
